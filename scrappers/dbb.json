    "description": "Centrally located in the desirable Fox Farm neighborhood, Inn the Pines is a beautiful log-cabin style home. You'll love this quiet neighborhood that is filled with mature pine trees. \n\r\nWalk down a few steps to the front door and enter the home to find a wood alcove with a bench to store your outdoor gear, such as skiing equipment and boots. You'll soon notice that the walls of the home are decorated with sporting equipment and retro signs that celebrate the outdoors. \n\r\nNext, you'll encounter the open plan living area. Wood paneling covers the ceiling and several of the walls, giving the space a cozy vibe. Tile floors are featured throughout the main living area and kitchen. On chilly nights, create a fire in the wood-burning fireplace. Curl up on the couch and watch your favorite movie on the flat-screen television with DirecTV and Blu-Ray player. A ceiling fan will keep you cool during the warm summer months.\n\r\nThe kitchen features granite counter tops and stainless steel appliances. It's spacious, with plenty of countertop space, a great bonus if you're hosting a holiday feast or wanting to spend an afternoon baking. Features of the kitchen include a gas oven, microwave, dishwasher, and coffee pot.\n\r\nServe your meal at the dining table, located near the living room. The wood dining table has four chairs and a wood bench. Open the curtains and enjoy views of the backyard while dining.

The property includes two large decks, perfect for watching boating on the lake or enjoying a barbequed dinner during sunset. At Tippie Canoe, you'll have a front row seat to the Fourth of July Fireworks: one of Big Bear Lake's biggest annual events. In the winter, you'll enjoy the serenity of watching snow fall on the water. Stunning lake views are the star of Tippie Canoe!\n\r\nThis property is built on the side of a mountain and includes a steep set of stairs the first deck, with the front door located on the side of the house. This would not be the best property for guests with mobility issues.\n\r\nWhen you enter the home, you will discover the stairs to the upper level on your right, and the door to the master suite directly in front of you. The spacious master suite features a king size bed facing a window to maximize those lake views. The master suite also includes a flat-screen television with DirecTV and an ensuite 3/4 bathroom.\n\r\nRelaxation is key to a perfect vacation. To help you achieve that goal, Tippie Canoe has an indoor spa and sauna. Located in a separate room adjacent to the master suite, the spa and sauna are excellent places to unwind. Since they are located within the house, you can enjoy these features year-round, however for a magical experience, this room opens on to the lower balcony, providing you with stellar views of the lake as you soak in the spa.\n\r\nWalk upstairs to the second level of the home and you'll find yourself in the cozy living room. Warm up with a wood burning fireplace as you curl up on the couch and enjoy those lake views or watch a movie on the flat-screen television with DirecTV. Show off your competitive side, with a friendly game of air hockey.\n\r\nThe kitchen has tile countertops and includes essential appliances; such as a coffee pot, dishwasher, and microwave. A breakfast bar divides the dining area from the kitchen. The dining area has a six person wood dining table with stunning lake views. If you enjoy grilling, the upper level deck includes a propane barbeque and it is convienantly located with access from the dining room.\n\r\nNo one wants to do laundry on vacation, but if you're planning an extended stay or have a clothing emergency, it's a huge bonus to have a washer and dryer handy. Tippie Canoe has you covered with a full-size washer and dryer located in a separate space behind the kitchen and near the back bedroom.\n\r\nTwo bedrooms and a full-bathroom are located on the upper level. The first bedroom is off the living room and features lake views. This bedroom has a bunk-bed (full bottom/twin top) that is perfect for the kids in your group. The second bedroom is in the back of the house and has a window with forest views. This bedroom features a queen bed, and although the bathroom is not attached, this is the closest room to the full bathroom.\n\r\nThis property has lake access, but NO DOCK availability. The access point provides a good shoreline for launching non-motorized watercraft. There is additional off street boat parking available directly across the street from the home. \n\nNote: Tippie Canoe is kid friendly but please note that although the property  does have a small backyard, it is not fenced or an appropriate area for  children to play. Please accompany small children when crossing the road  to the lake. Speakers next to spa are not for tenants use. This is a very old cabin with old stairs.  \n\n***DUE TO DROUGHT CONDITIONS AND EXTREMELY LOW WATER LEVELS, THE BOAT DOCK IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.***\n\r\nLake levels vary throughout the year and boat docks availability is not guaranteed at the time of your arrival. Destination Big Bear is not responsible for the level of water in the lake during the course of guest's stay.

    "description": "Located on Metcalf Bay, 29 Pines is a charming multilevel home surrounded by mature pine trees and featuring fabulous lake views. This home is just a short walk to the lake with private access and close to Pleasure Point Marina.\u00a0 Great restaurants and shops can be found on the main road and it's a quick, ten-minute drive to Big Bear Village. The lake views and excellent location are key reasons that 29 Pines is a wonderful place to spend your Big Bear vacation.\n\r\nAs you approach 29 Pines, you'll notice the inviting exterior design, which includes a brick chimney, green trim, and both the shutters and door painted in a cheerful cherry red.\n\r\nPark your vehicle at the front door and walk up two steps to enter 29 Pines. As you enter the home, you'll see the open-floor-plan living space.\n\r\nWood is featured prominently in the living room, with its wood floors, wood paneled walls, and vaulted wood ceilings. The honey color of the wood and a large area rug make the living room an extra-cozy space. The wood-burning fireplace adds additional warmth and ambiance. Enjoy a large 64\" smart tv in living room with streaming and bluray player. (Wi-Fi only. No cable.)\n\r\nWhipping up a home-cooked meal and enjoying it with your friends and family is one of the best parts of a cabin rental vacation. The kitchen is located adjacent to the living room and in it you'll find all the basics needed to make a meal. Imagine starting the morning with the rich aroma of brewing coffee and a batch of blueberry pancakes? Or warming up after a day on the slopes with a hearty homemade lasagna? With its wood floors and white cabinets, the kitchen also includes a gas stove, coffee pot, microwave and dishwasher.\n\r\nBetween the kitchen and living room, you'll find the dining room, located just a few steps up from the main floor. The wood dining table seats eight. Additional seating for two can be found at a long bar-style table, which faces the dining area. The dining room has glass doors leading to a deck with patio furniture and a propane BBQ. Grill a steak and enjoy dinner in the fresh mountain air!\u00a0 A full-size bathroom is also located on this level.\n\r\nGetting sleepy? Walk downstairs to find 29 Pine's two bedrooms located on the lower level. The master bedroom has a king bed with lake views. The second bedroom features two full beds with forest views. The two bedrooms share a full bathroom that is located off the downstairs hallway. Both bedrooms have carpeting to keep your feet warm..\n\r\nNo one likes to do laundry while on vacation, but should the need arise, a stacked washer and dryer is located in the downstairs bathroom.\n\r\nA mountain escape means putting down our electronic devices and enjoying time with family and friends. Board games and cards are a favorite group activity for all-ages. If you're looking for games, head up to the loft, which is accessible by the spiral staircase located in the main living area. Don't worry if you want to stay in the loop with the outside world while in Big Bear, 29 Pines has Wi-Fi. \n\r\n29 Pines is a delightful home with close proximity to the lake, making it an inviting accommodation for your Big Bear vacation.\n\r\nFeatures: Wood-Burning Fireplace, Deck, Propane Grill, Wifi, Washer and Dryer, Board Game Room, Electric Stove, Microwave, Dishwasher, Coffee Pot, Close to Lake with Private Access\n\nThis cabin is perfect for vacationers seeking pleasant and well-appointed accommodations.\u00a0 Generally features comfortable furnishing, desirable amenities, with possibly a few original features or appliances.",

    "description": "3 Sisters Lodge is nestled at the end of a cul-de-sac in the quiet neighborhood of Fox Farm. As you walk up to the home, you'll be greeted by a friendly bear statue and you'll discover cute bird feeders hanging from the trees. There is a short set of stairs to the front door, but adjacent to the stairs, you'll also find a mobility ramp.\n\r\nImmediately upon entering the home, you'll notice the wildlife and mountain theme that is carried throughout the entire cabin. Turn left from the entry hall to enter the living room. Cozy is the key-word to describe this living room. It features comfortable leather sofas, a wood-burning fireplace, and a thoughtful basket of plush blankets to keep you warm. Lack of entertainment options will never be an issue at 3 Sisters Lodge. The living room comes stocked with board games for all ages. Watch your favorite movies on the flat-screen television that includes HDTV and DVD player.\n\r\nTo the left of the living room, you'll find a game room with a Foosball table and shuffleboard. Sit at the high-top bar table and enjoy a drink, while waiting for your turn to play.\n\r\nNext to the living room, on the opposite side of the game room, you'll find the dining room.

The property is surrounded by mature trees, which provide both privacy and the feeling of being in nature. The fenced backyard is a great bonus for guests with young children,\u00a0 providing a secure place for kids to play. Your family will love the concreated/covered deck and the large gazebo. Many of the homes in Big Bear simply do not have such a safe and inviting yard.\n\r\nWhen you enter Dream Catcher, you'll find yourself in a spacious, open-plan living area with high ceilings. Immediately, you'll notice the gas fireplace, which features a four-sided glass panel, allowing guests to enjoy the illumination from all sides. You can enjoy the fireplace while cooking in the kitchen! Imagine how cozy the home will feel when you have a fire burning in the fireplace and the fragrance of a hearty dinner being prepared wafts over from the kitchen.\n\r\nJust off the living room, you'll find a chef's paradise.

The layout of Dream Catcher is ideal for socializing.\n\r\nThe dining room nook is located off the kitchen and includes an eight-seat wood dining table sitting beneath an antler chandelier. Large windows line the dining room, providing plenty of light and beautiful views. If you require extra seating, the kitchen includes a breakfast bar with four stools; always a fun option for the kids in your group. A slider off of the dining room is the entry to a small deck outfitted with wooden Adirondak chairs. On warm evenings, this is a perfect area for adults to enjoy a pre-dinner cocktail. It's also a sunny spot in the afternoon, a great place to enjoy a book while taking in the clean mountain air.\n\r\nHead upstairs and you'll find three bedrooms. The master bedroom well-appointed, with a king bed, flatscreen television, and sitting area with a couch. This room is airy and clean, with rustic decor: such as a carved-wood bedframe and bear art. The master includes an ensuite full-bath, with a separate jacuzzi tub. The jacuzzi tub is the perfect place to melt away aches after a day of hitting the ski slopes or trail hiking. Windows frame the tub, allowing you to double up on the relaxation by enjoying nature while you soak.\n\r\nIf you have children, the second bedroom will suit your family. Kids will feel like they're having a slumber party as they sleep on a bunk with two full beds and a twin pull-out. This room is not limited to families with kids, adults can fit in these beds too! This room has a lodge theme, with animal print wallpaper and a bass fish sign on the wall.\n\r\nThe third bedroom includes two twin beds and is decorated in shabby-chic, with plenty of storage space. The two smaller bedrooms include a shared full-bath located in the hall.
