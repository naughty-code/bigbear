    "description": "Looking for incredible views of Bear Mountain Ski Resort? Look no further than Gentle Grizzly Getaway, located on a quiet street in the neighborhood of Upper Moonridge.\n\r\nPark your vehicle on a flat-driveway and walk through a garden gate to be greeted by a welcome bear statue sitting on a rock. If you arrive at night, you'll appreciate that he is holding a lantern! The double-door entry is located just a few steps up and features pretty glass windows.\n\r\nGentle Grizzly Getaway has a front entrance with wood flooring. The flooring throughout the home includes both wood and carpet.\n\r\nTurn left and you're in the living room. The beautiful stone fireplace provides both warmth and ambiance. A large elk head is mounted over the gas only fireplace, giving the home a touch of rustic decor. Entertainment is close at hand, with the Pac Man classic video game table and flat-screen television that is equipped with HDTV cable and a DVD player. Wifi will keep you connected with the outside world, but plenty of board games are available for an unplugged pastime. Pour a glass of wine or mix your favorite cocktail at the wet bar, located just behind the living room couch. High above the city smog, we have amazing views of the stars. Use the telescope to get a closer look.\n\r\nA door between the living and dining room gives you access to the outdoor deck with incredible views of Bear Mountain Ski Resort. Sore muscles from a day on the slopes or nearby hiking trails? Melt them away in the relaxing hot tub. When the weather is warm, sit back in the wicker deck furniture and enjoy the view. Grill up a steak on the propane bbq.\n\r\nHead back inside to discover the dining room table, which seats six, but also includes two additional chairs for more hungry guests. Look up to notice the chandelier, with a carved wolf motif.\n\r\nThe kitchen comes with all the basics that you'll need to create a home-cooked meal. If you're visiting us during the holidays and cooking up a feast, you'll find the counter top space and storage to be plentiful. Features of the kitchen include: tiled counters, a double oven, microwave, dishwasher, trash compactor, and coffee pot. The cook won't feel left out of the vacation, as those amazing slope views are visible from large windows in both the kitchen and dining areas.\n\r\nWhen it's time for bed, Gentle Grizzly Getaway offers you a choice of three bedrooms. The master and second bedroom are both located upstairs.\n\r\nThe master bedroom has a queen bed located under a skylight, a great spot to look at the night sky as you drift off to sleep. Before falling asleep, watch a movie on the flat screen television with HDTV cable and a dvd player. Walk outside to enjoy your private deck with views of the slopes. During a sunny day, relax on the two outdoor lounge beds. The master includes an en suite 3/4 bathroom.\n\r\nThe second bedroom has a queen bed, television with HDTV cable, and DVD player. This room also has a private deck, with views of the gated front garden. A full bathroom is located in the hall, between the master and second bedroom.\n\r\nThe third bedroom is located on the first level, to the right of the main entry door. This room is perfect for kids, with a twin over twin bunk bed and an additional twin bed. This room has moose and bear themed bedding. Need to do laundry? A full-size, side-by-side washer and dryer is located in the closet of this bedroom.\n\r\nA half-bath for the first level is located near the third bedroom. \n\r\nCome visit Gentle Grizzly Getaway, with its stellar views and many amenities. You'll experience the serenity of nature, but be located just a ten minute drive from all the restaurants, shops, and Big Bear activities.\n\r\nFeatures: Bear Mountain Resort Views, Pac Man VIdeo Game Table, Gas Only Fireplace, Flat-screen Television, HDTV Cable, Wifi, DVD Player, Propane BBQ, Hot Tub, Wet Bar, Telescope, Microwave, Coffee Pot, Trash Compactor, Dishwasher, Washer and Dryer.\n\nThis cabin is perfect for vacationers seeking pleasant and well-appointed accommodations.\u00a0 Generally features comfortable furnishing, desirable amenities, with possibly a few original features or appliances.

    "description": "Centrally located in the desirable Fox Farm neighborhood, Inn the Pines is a beautiful log-cabin style home. You'll love this quiet neighborhood that is filled with mature pine trees. \n\r\nWalk down a few steps to the front door and enter the home to find a wood alcove with a bench to store your outdoor gear, such as skiing equipment and boots. You'll soon notice that the walls of the home are decorated with sporting equipment and retro signs that celebrate the outdoors. \n\r\nNext, you'll encounter the open plan living area. Wood paneling covers the ceiling and several of the walls, giving the space a cozy vibe. Tile floors are featured throughout the main living area and kitchen. On chilly nights, create a fire in the wood-burning fireplace. Curl up on the couch and watch your favorite movie on the flat-screen television with DirecTV and Blu-Ray player. A ceiling fan will keep you cool during the warm summer months.\n\r\nThe kitchen features granite counter tops and stainless steel appliances. It's spacious, with plenty of countertop space, a great bonus if you're hosting a holiday feast or wanting to spend an afternoon baking. Features of the kitchen include a gas oven, microwave, dishwasher, and coffee pot.\n\r\nServe your meal at the dining table, located near the living room. The wood dining table has four chairs and a wood bench. Open the curtains and enjoy views of the backyard while dining. An additional seating option can be found at the wood breakfast bar with four stools.\n\r\nSpeaking of bars, pour a glass of wine or craft your favorite cocktail at the wet bar, located next to the dining table. Play bartender as you stand behind a custom-made wood bar with a antler chandelier. The wet bar includes a mini-fridge.\n\r\nAccess to a wood deck and the backyard is through a sliding glass door near the dining table. Grill a juicy steak on the propane grill. Enjoy the fresh mountain air, while sitting around a four person table with built-in fire pit. Beautiful trees with bird feeders will attract feathered locals to the backyard. The yard is fully-fenced, making it a safe place for children to play.\n\r\nBack inside the home, walk up a few steps near the kitchen to find yourself on the mid-level of the house. Open the door immediately in front of you to discover that the garage has been converted into a game room. A portable heater will keep you warm during the summer months. Challenge your friends to a friendly game of pool or darts.\u00a0 A half-bath is also located on this level.\n\n\r\nWalk upstairs to find three bedrooms. No one wants to do laundry while on vacation, but should the need arise, you'll find a side-by-side washer and dryer in the upstairs closet.\n\r\nThe master bedroom is a true oasis. It has a king bed, ceiling fan, and wood-burning fireplace. Enjoy the stars at night from your private deck, which faces the front of the house. Use the telescope for a closer look. Stay entertained with the flat-screen television with DirecTV and DVD player. The en suite bathroom has recently been updated and includes a stone shower, Jacuzzi tub, bidet, and toilet.\n\r\nThe second bedroom has a full bed, ceiling fan, flat-screen television with DirecTV. The window provides views of the front of the home.\n\r\nThe third bedroom is perfect for kids and it includes a twin over full bunk, flat-screen television and DirecTV. The window provides views of the front of the home.\n\r\nThe third and fourth bedrooms share a full-sized bathroom, with access in each bedroom.\n\r\nAdditional sleeping space can be found in the living room on the sleeper sofa.\n\r\nInn the Pines is a beautiful home, stocked with many amenities.

The property includes two large decks, perfect for watching boating on the lake or enjoying a barbequed dinner during sunset. At Tippie Canoe, you'll have a front row seat to the Fourth of July Fireworks: one of Big Bear Lake's biggest annual events. In the winter, you'll enjoy the serenity of watching snow fall on the water. Stunning lake views are the star of Tippie Canoe!\n\r\nThis property is built on the side of a mountain and includes a steep set of stairs the first deck, with the front door located on the side of the house. This would not be the best property for guests with mobility issues.\n\r\nWhen you enter the home, you will discover the stairs to the upper level on your right, and the door to the master suite directly in front of you. The spacious master suite features a king size bed facing a window to maximize those lake views. The master suite also includes a flat-screen television with DirecTV and an ensuite 3/4 bathroom.\n\r\nRelaxation is key to a perfect vacation. To help you achieve that goal, Tippie Canoe has an indoor spa and sauna. Located in a separate room adjacent to the master suite, the spa and sauna are excellent places to unwind. Since they are located within the house, you can enjoy these features year-round, however for a magical experience, this room opens on to the lower balcony, providing you with stellar views of the lake as you soak in the spa.\n\r\nWalk upstairs to the second level of the home and you'll find yourself in the cozy living room. Warm up with a wood burning fireplace as you curl up on the couch and enjoy those lake views or watch a movie on the flat-screen television with DirecTV. Show off your competitive side, with a friendly game of air hockey.\n\r\nThe kitchen has tile countertops and includes essential appliances; such as a coffee pot, dishwasher, and microwave. A breakfast bar divides the dining area from the kitchen. The dining area has a six person wood dining table with stunning lake views. If you enjoy grilling, the upper level deck includes a propane barbeque and it is convienantly located with access from the dining room.\n\r\nNo one wants to do laundry on vacation, but if you're planning an extended stay or have a clothing emergency, it's a huge bonus to have a washer and dryer handy. Tippie Canoe has you covered with a full-size washer and dryer located in a separate space behind the kitchen and near the back bedroom.\n\r\nTwo bedrooms and a full-bathroom are located on the upper level. The first bedroom is off the living room and features lake views. This bedroom has a bunk-bed (full bottom/twin top) that is perfect for the kids in your group. The second bedroom is in the back of the house and has a window with forest views. This bedroom features a queen bed, and although the bathroom is not attached, this is the closest room to the full bathroom.\n\r\nThis property has lake access, but NO DOCK availability. The access point provides a good shoreline for launching non-motorized watercraft. There is additional off street boat parking available directly across the street from the home. \n\nNote: Tippie Canoe is kid friendly but please note that although the property  does have a small backyard, it is not fenced or an appropriate area for  children to play. Please accompany small children when crossing the road  to the lake. Speakers next to spa are not for tenants use. This is a very old cabin with old stairs.  \n\n***DUE TO DROUGHT CONDITIONS AND EXTREMELY LOW WATER LEVELS, THE BOAT DOCK IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.***\n\r\nLake levels vary throughout the year and boat docks availability is not guaranteed at the time of your arrival. Destination Big Bear is not responsible for the level of water in the lake during the course of guest's stay.

    "description": "When you pull up in front of this cabin, the first thing you will notice is that the entire front of the cabin is largely made up of glass windows that let all of that beautiful mountain sunlight into your vacation cabin that will help make you feel perfectly at home.\n\r\nWhen you walk in, you will be right back in the Wild West, but with the much loved luxuries that we\u2019ve come to expect these days. You will have the best of both worlds with the large Jacuzzi outside to relax in, the huge flat screen TV in the living room, and the large comfortable beds to sleep in at night. With the open floor plan, you can be upstairs playing pool and watching TV on the new 32\" TV that is connected to the living room programing, and still be connected to the rest of the family downstairs playing board games or watching TV.\n\r\nAnd to make this cabin even more perfect for your family, there are many personal touches made by the homeowners that help you feel a connection to their family and their home, their way of making you feel like part of the family.

Immediately, you'll notice the gas fireplace, which features a four-sided glass panel, allowing guests to enjoy the illumination from all sides. You can enjoy the fireplace while cooking in the kitchen! Imagine how cozy the home will feel when you have a fire burning in the fireplace and the fragrance of a hearty dinner being prepared wafts over from the kitchen.\n\r\nJust off the living room, you'll find a chef's paradise.

Large windows line the dining room, providing plenty of light and beautiful views. If you require extra seating, the kitchen includes a breakfast bar with four stools; always a fun option for the kids in your group. A slider off of the dining room is the entry to a small deck outfitted with wooden Adirondak chairs. On warm evenings, this is a perfect area for adults to enjoy a pre-dinner cocktail. It's also a sunny spot in the afternoon, a great place to enjoy a book while taking in the clean mountain air.\n\r\nHead upstairs and you'll find three bedrooms. The master bedroom well-appointed, with a king bed, flatscreen television, and sitting area with a couch. This room is airy and clean, with rustic decor: such as a carved-wood bedframe and bear art. The master includes an ensuite full-bath, with a separate jacuzzi tub. The jacuzzi tub is the perfect place to melt away aches after a day of hitting the ski slopes or trail hiking. Windows frame the tub, allowing you to double up on the relaxation by enjoying nature while you soak.\n\r\nIf you have children, the second bedroom will suit your family. Kids will feel like they're having a slumber party as they sleep on a bunk with two full beds and a twin pull-out. This room is not limited to families with kids, adults can fit in these beds too!
